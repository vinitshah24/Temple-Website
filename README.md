<h1>WEBSITE OVERVIEW </h1>
I have used several jQuery UI and plugins for making the website more interactive. On the index.html page, I have implemented a move-top plugin which allows the user to directly move to the top of the page by clicking the button. On this page, I have also created a slider by using JavaScript. On the About.html page, I have implemented Ajax functionality where I am reading the JSON files and parsing out information to display on the button click. On the Events.html page, I have implemented another jQuery Events UI which displays all the upcoming events for the current month. On the Gallery.html page, I have implemented a jQuery image slider which displays pictures of the events or festivals celebrated at the temple. On the contact page, I have implemented a social media slider plugin which allows the user to quickly navigate to the social media links of the temple. I have also implemented a google map iframe which shows the location of the temple. On FlickrGallery.html, I have implemented another Ajax request. Here, I am using Flickr API to request a JSON file for a specific hashtag and then parsing it using Ajax to display the images.

<b>I have followed the accessibility guidelines by following several techniques from the WCAG2 guidelines:</b>

1.1	Text Alternatives

I have ensured that all my images have the alt attribute with relevant information about the image. 

1.2	Adaptable  

I have ensured that everything in the website is arranged in the logical format and follow a sequence. I have used Aria landmarks to identify certain important places in the website.

1.3	Distinguishable 

This guideline states that if the color of particular words is used to indicate information, ensure that information is conveyed by color differences. In my webpages, I have ensured that all my webpage titles have consistent size and color throughout the website. I have also ensured that a particular color is only used once for specific purpose. The red color text is only used for page title. I have used text colors sparingly and only for highlighting important titles. 

2.4	Navigable

I have all the pages titled which describes the purpose or topics of the webpage. I have also ensured that the order of the pages is well focused. Each page contains links of other pages in the navigation bar. For the accessibility, I have included a go-top plugin which helps the user to quickly scroll to top by just clicking on the arrow button. I have also used section headings for organizing the content throughout the webpages. 

3.1	Readable

I have used language attributes for all the webpages to ensure that the webpage is readable in English. I have also used another language (Gujarati) in my index page. To ensure that it is readable, I have included another language attribute for that language. I have ensured that my website doesnâ€™t contain any unusual words or abbreviations. 

3.2	 Predictable

I have ensured that a user who is visiting my website for first time is able to easily predict the basic layout and functionality of all the components. I have ensured consistent navigation by using json and ajax to reduce the page loading and provide easy access to the information on same location. 

3.3	Input Assistance 

For the error identification, I have used error messages for all the input fields whenever something is missing or not in required format. I have included placeholder text for instructions. I have also included detailed labels for all the input fields. I have used red asterisks for input fields which cannot be kept empty.
